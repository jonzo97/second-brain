Foundational context for how this second brain should be designed. Any future system (OpenClaw, automations, dashboards) should be built around these constraints.

## Who I Am

- **Role**: Field Applications Engineer (FAE) at Microchip Technology
- **Background**: Hardware/electrical engineering, NOT a software engineer
- **Coding experience**: Limited recent experience prior to AI journey, learning fast
- **Unique angle**: Hardware person building software tools - different perspective than most in the AI space
- **Personality**: Stubborn problem-solver. Won't beat head against wall, will find creative workarounds

## The AI Journey

Started ~2024 after getting stood up on a date by a girl using ChatGPT for law school homework. Thought "I can do this, and I can probably optimize it." The engineer brain kicked in.

**Progression:**
1. Started with ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek as basic users
2. Got deeper into tool usage and workflow integration
3. Relationship ended, went off the deep end learning everything
4. Went from simple user to:
   - Building own memory systems
   - Building orchestration systems
   - Building agentic frameworks (cc_agents)
   - Building MCP servers (sales intelligence, FPGA tools)
   - Learning prompt engineering and context engineering
   - Keeping up with cutting edge (MCP -> direct code execution)
5. Got involved with internal MCHP team building agentic orchestration for CAD tools
6. Now one of the more advanced AI practitioners in the field engineering space

**What makes this unique:**
- Not many FAEs are building their own MCP servers with sales intelligence
- Not many hardware people are building orchestration tools
- Coming from hardware gives different problem-solving instincts
- Stubborn enough to push through blockers that stop most people
- Real-world integration experience in a sales organization, not just toy projects
- On an internal MCHP team building agentic orchestration tools for CAD software

**The stubbornness, clarified:**
Not brute-force stubborn. If the obvious path is blocked, won't keep banging on it. Will step back, find a creative workaround, and get there a different way. Not afraid of things that block me - just won't waste time on dead ends. This instinct comes from hardware debugging where you can't just "try again" - you have to understand why.

**Career positioning:**
All of this learning isn't just for fun. Being one of the few FAEs who can build AI tools, understand agentic architectures, and integrate them into real workflows is a significant career differentiator. The LinkedIn series, the open-source contributions, and the team involvement all feed into becoming a recognized voice in the AI + hardware intersection.

**The social angle:**
Beyond career - want to find people to collaborate with, learn from, and talk to about this stuff. The LinkedIn series isn't just broadcasting, it's finding a tribe. Being on the cutting edge can be lonely when nobody around you is doing the same things.

## How My Brain Works (ADHD)

**This is the #1 design constraint for everything.**

### The Core Problem
- If things are not RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, I forget they exist
- Motivation is momentum-based - once rolling, can go for hours; getting started is the hard part
- Default behavior when bored: YouTube, hanging out (path of least resistance)
- Opening Claude and figuring out a project to work on feels like too much friction ("pain in the ass")
- Things get lost: Chrome tabs, Claude chats, voice memos, ideas
- **Activation energy**: even opening a tool is sometimes too much. System needs to PUSH things to me, not wait for me to pull.

### The Repetition Trap
- Morning brain dumps often cover the same ground without progressing to action
- Example: have discussed the LinkedIn series at least 6 times in brain dumps without writing a single post
- This is the classic ADHD planning-without-executing loop
- **The system needs to detect this**: "You've mentioned X six times. Here's the smallest possible next step."

### What Works
- **Low friction access** - if I can get to something in <10 seconds, I'll use it
- **Being presented with options** - "here's your low-hanging fruit" beats "what do you want to work on?"
- **Momentum** - once I pick something and start, I can go deep
- **Interest-driven** - let me pick what suits my mood for the day/hour
- **Passive learning** - podcasts, audio content I can consume at gym/lunch/bed
- **Brain dumps** - talking through problems out loud, then processing the transcript
- **This repo as a brain dump venue** - Claude Code sessions like this one ARE brain dumps that get captured and organized in real time

### What Doesn't Work
- **Live AI models** (Gemini Live, ChatGPT Live, Claude Live) - tested extensively, disappointed:
  - Not enough technical depth
  - Not well researched
  - Hard to keep on track and focused
  - ChatGPT especially annoying recently - surface-level, not actionable
  - Not a viable way to brainstorm or "get brain in gear"
- Long-form reading when not in the mood
- Being told what to do in rigid order
- Anything that requires multiple steps to access
- Planning without a forcing function to execute

### Current Brain Dump Workflow
1. Google Recorder on Pixel 10 Pro
2. 15-20+ minute voice dumps in the morning
3. Talk through problems, to-do lists, tasks, ideas
4. Extract transcript from recording
5. Dump into a Claude chat
6. **Problem**: Gets lost in the sea of Claude chats, never resurfaced
7. **Problem**: Often repeats the same topics without progressing to action
8. **Problem**: Valuable technical conversations also scattered across many Claude chats

## What I Need From This System

### Immediate Wins
- [ ] Stuff I can listen to passively (NotebookLM podcasts on learning topics)
- [ ] Quick access from phone (Google Drive organized, Pixel + Gemini assistant)
- [ ] "What should I work on?" prompt that shows low-hanging fruit by interest area
- [ ] Brain dump ingestion that actually extracts and tracks action items

### Medium-Term
- [ ] Remote Claude Code access from phone (SSH setup)
- [ ] OpenClaw as always-on assistant
- [ ] Automated trend tracking (YouTube, HuggingFace, GitHub)

### Medium-Term
- [ ] Remote Claude Code access from phone (SSH setup)
- [ ] OpenClaw as always-on assistant
- [ ] Automated trend tracking (YouTube, HuggingFace, GitHub)
- [ ] Spaced repetition system for technical learning (terminology, concepts)
- [ ] Claude chat history export → RAG for mining past conversations

### Long-Term
- [ ] Full second brain: Obsidian + OpenClaw + automations
- [ ] LinkedIn thought leadership series
- [ ] Teaching others what I've learned

## The Big Picture Goals

Everything in this system serves these outcomes:
1. **Gain momentum** - reduce friction to start, maintain streaks
2. **Stay current** - keep up with the AI world without it feeling like work
3. **Accelerate learning** - passive + active, spaced repetition, right terminology
4. **Be better at my job** - the FAE who actually integrates AI, not just talks about it
5. **Prepare for the future** - career positioning, network building, skill stacking
