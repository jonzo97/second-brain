Foundational context for how this second brain should be designed. Any future system (OpenClaw, automations, dashboards) should be built around these constraints.

---

## Who I Am

- **Role**: Field Applications Engineer (FAE) at Microchip Technology
- **Background**: Hardware/electrical engineering, NOT a software engineer
- **Coding experience**: Limited recent experience prior to AI journey, learning fast
- **Unique angle**: Hardware person building software tools - different perspective than most in the AI space
- **Personality**: Stubborn problem-solver. Won't beat head against wall, will find creative workarounds

## The AI Journey

Started ~2024 after getting stood up on a date by a girl using ChatGPT for law school homework. Thought "I can do this, and I can probably optimize it." The engineer brain kicked in.

**Progression:**
1. Started with ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek as basic users
2. Got deeper into tool usage and workflow integration
3. Relationship ended, went off the deep end learning everything
4. Went from simple user to:
   - Building own memory systems
   - Building orchestration systems
   - Building agentic frameworks (cc_agents)
   - Building MCP servers (sales intelligence, FPGA tools)
   - Learning prompt engineering and context engineering
   - Keeping up with cutting edge (MCP -> direct code execution)
5. Got involved with internal MCHP team building agentic orchestration for CAD tools
6. Now one of the more advanced AI practitioners in the field engineering space

**What makes this unique:**
- Not many FAEs are building their own MCP servers with sales intelligence
- Not many hardware people are building orchestration tools
- Coming from hardware gives different problem-solving instincts
- Stubborn enough to push through blockers that stop most people
- Real-world integration experience in a sales organization, not just toy projects

## How My Brain Works (ADHD)

**This is the #1 design constraint for everything.**

### The Core Problem
- If things are not RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME, I forget they exist
- Motivation is momentum-based - once rolling, can go for hours; getting started is the hard part
- Default behavior when bored: YouTube, hanging out (path of least resistance)
- Opening Claude and figuring out a project to work on feels like too much friction
- Things get lost: Chrome tabs, Claude chats, voice memos, ideas

### What Works
- **Low friction access** - if I can get to something in <10 seconds, I'll use it
- **Being presented with options** - "here's your low-hanging fruit" beats "what do you want to work on?"
- **Momentum** - once I pick something and start, I can go deep
- **Interest-driven** - let me pick what suits my mood for the day/hour
- **Passive learning** - podcasts, audio content I can consume at gym/lunch/bed
- **Brain dumps** - talking through problems out loud, then processing the transcript

### What Doesn't Work
- Live AI models (Gemini Live, ChatGPT Live, Claude Live) - not enough depth, hard to keep on track, disappointing
- Long-form reading when not in the mood
- Being told what to do in rigid order
- Anything that requires multiple steps to access

### Current Brain Dump Workflow
1. Google Recorder on Pixel 10 Pro
2. 15-20+ minute voice dumps in the morning
3. Talk through problems, to-do lists, tasks, ideas
4. Extract transcript from recording
5. Dump into a Claude chat
6. **Problem**: Gets lost in the sea of Claude chats, never resurfaced

## What I Need From This System

### Immediate Wins
- [ ] Stuff I can listen to passively (NotebookLM podcasts on learning topics)
- [ ] Quick access from phone (Google Drive organized, Pixel + Gemini assistant)
- [ ] "What should I work on?" prompt that shows low-hanging fruit by interest area
- [ ] Brain dump ingestion that actually extracts and tracks action items

### Medium-Term
- [ ] Remote Claude Code access from phone (SSH setup)
- [ ] OpenClaw as always-on assistant
- [ ] Automated trend tracking (YouTube, HuggingFace, GitHub)

### Long-Term
- [ ] Full second brain: Obsidian + OpenClaw + automations
- [ ] LinkedIn thought leadership series
- [ ] Teaching others what I've learned
