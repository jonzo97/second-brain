# Second Brain

A curated collection of tools, repos, articles, and things to explore. Personal knowledge base and "second brain" - imported from Chrome bookmarks and expanded over time. Will eventually integrate with OpenClaw + Obsidian.

**Design principle**: Optimized for ADHD - low friction, quick access, "show me my options" over "figure out what to do." See [PROFILE.md](PROFILE.md) for full context.

## Structure

- `PROFILE.md` - Who I am, how I work, ADHD constraints, devices & subscriptions
- `bookmarks/` - Raw bookmark exports and structured data
- `topics/` - Organized by topic area (see below)
