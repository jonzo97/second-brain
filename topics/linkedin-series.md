# LinkedIn Series: My AI Journey

A planned series of LinkedIn posts documenting Jon's path from AI novice to building agentic frameworks. Goal: share lessons, find collaborators, build thought leadership.

## Why Write This

- Very few FAEs/hardware engineers are doing what Jon is doing with AI
- Real-world integration experience in a sales org is rare and valuable
- Could attract collaborators, new connections, job opportunities
- Forces reflection and consolidation of what's been learned
- Helps others who are earlier in their journey

## The Story Arc

### Origin Story
- Got stood up on a date by a girl using ChatGPT for law school homework
- "I can do this, and probably optimize it" - the engineer brain kicks in
- Started with ChatGPT, Gemini, DeepSeek as a basic user
- Relationship ended, channeled energy into learning everything

### The Progression
1. **Basic user** - Asking questions, getting answers
2. **Workflow integration** - Using AI daily in FAE work
3. **Tool builder** - Building MCP servers for sales intelligence
4. **System architect** - Memory systems, orchestration, agentic frameworks (cc_agents)
5. **Pattern developer** - Context engineering, prompt patterns, multi-agent coordination
6. **Ecosystem contributor** - Internal MCHP team for CAD tool orchestration

### Key Themes to Explore

#### "I'm Not a Software Engineer" Series
- [ ] Coming from hardware - different problem-solving instincts
- [ ] What it's like to learn coding through AI assistance
- [ ] The Anthropic research on "How AI assistance impacts coding skills" is directly relevant
- [ ] Stubborn workarounds > elegant solutions (and why that's actually fine)
- [ ] You don't need a CS degree to build useful tools

#### "AI in Sales Engineering" Series
- [ ] How AI changed my day-to-day as an FAE
- [ ] Building MCP servers for sales intelligence (technical + practical)
- [ ] ROI of AI integration in a field engineering role
- [ ] What my colleagues think (and why most aren't doing this)
- [ ] The gap between "AI curious" and "AI integrated"

#### "Building in Public" Series
- [ ] The memory system evolution (CLAUDE.md → Memory Bank → second brain)
- [ ] Why I built my own orchestration tools instead of using off-the-shelf
- [ ] MCP → direct code execution: keeping up with the cutting edge
- [ ] Failures and dead ends (important to be honest about these)
- [ ] The tools that actually stuck vs. the ones I abandoned

#### "Lessons & Hot Takes" Series
- [ ] Live AI models are disappointing (and here's why)
- [ ] ADHD and AI: how I use AI to compensate for executive function
- [ ] The difference between knowing about AI and actually using it
- [ ] Why prompt engineering is overrated and context engineering matters more
- [ ] The tools I wish existed (and am trying to build)

## Format Ideas

- **Short posts** (300-500 words): Hot takes, single insights, questions for engagement
- **Long posts** (1000-1500 words): Deep dives on specific topics with examples
- **Carousel/slides**: Step-by-step breakdowns (how I built X)
- **Before/after**: My workflow before AI vs. after

## Writing Process

1. Brain dump on the topic (voice recording)
2. Process transcript into outline
3. Draft with Claude assistance (but keep the authentic voice)
4. Review for anything work-sensitive (no proprietary MCHP info)
5. Post and engage with comments

## Content Calendar (Draft)

Not committing to dates yet, but rough ordering:

1. **Intro post**: "How getting stood up on a date led me to build AI agents" (hook)
2. **Context post**: "I'm a hardware engineer, not a software dev. Here's why that matters."
3. **First technical post**: Pick the most accessible project to break down
4. **Reflection post**: "What I got wrong about AI in my first 6 months"
5. **Tool post**: "The AI tools I actually use every day (and the ones I dropped)"

## Notes

- Keep it authentic - don't over-polish, the raw perspective is the value
- Be honest about what I don't know
- Don't reveal proprietary MCHP info
- Link to open-source repos where possible
- Engage with comments - this is about finding people, not broadcasting
