## Spaced Repetition & Terminology

**Core concern**: Knowing how something works but not being able to name it properly undermines credibility in professional settings. "Not sounding dumb" requires having the right terminology on tap.

### System (To Build)
- [ ] After learning a new concept, create a review item (term + explanation + context)
- [ ] Review daily for 1 week, then weekly for 1 month
- [ ] Focus areas: framework names, architecture patterns, acronyms, correct terminology
- [ ] Could use Anki, a simple markdown file, or an OpenClaw quiz skill
- [ ] NotebookLM podcasts serve as passive reinforcement layer

### Prompt/Context Engineering (Active Learning Area)
- [ ] Struggled with prompt engineering - still learning
- [ ] Context engineering is where the real leverage is (and harder to learn)
- [ ] Resources: Anthropic Academy, agentic coding patterns from IndyDevDan
- [ ] This is a LinkedIn series topic too ("Why prompt engineering is overrated")

## Fundamentals to Learn (Priority)

These are knowledge gaps blocking progress on side projects. Good candidates for NotebookLM podcasts.

**NOTE**: These topics feed directly into the NotebookLM podcast pipeline (see google-drive.md). Generate a podcast → save to Drive → listen at gym.

### Docker
- [ ] Learn Docker fundamentals (images, containers, volumes, networking)
- [ ] Docker Compose for multi-service setups
- [ ] How n8n, OpenClaw, and other self-hosted tools use Docker
- [ ] **Make a NotebookLM podcast on Docker basics**

### Node.js
- [ ] Node.js fundamentals (event loop, npm, modules)
- [ ] Relevant because: OpenClaw is Node/TypeScript, MCP servers are often Node
- [ ] **Make a NotebookLM podcast on Node.js basics**

### React + Vercel
- [ ] React fundamentals (components, state, hooks)
- [ ] Vercel deployment workflow
- [ ] Relevant for: building web UIs for side projects, dashboards
- [ ] **Make a NotebookLM podcast on React + Vercel**

### Cloud / SSH / Remote Dev
- [ ] How SSH connections work for remote development
- [ ] Setting up cloud VMs (AWS/GCP basics)
- [ ] Tailscale for mesh VPN
- [ ] Claude Code remote/mobile setup via SSH
