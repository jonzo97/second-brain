# RAG & Knowledge Graphs

Retrieval-augmented generation and knowledge graph tools.

## RAG Implementations

- [ ] [RAGify](https://github.com/kanad13/RAGify) - Chat with your documents using GenAI & RAG
- [ ] [UniversalRAG](https://universalrag.github.io/) - RAG over corpora of diverse modalities and granularities

## Knowledge Graphs

- [ ] [knowledge_graph](https://github.com/rahulnyk/knowledge_graph) - Convert any text to a graph of knowledge, for Graph Augmented Generation or KG-based QnA

## Research Topics

- [ ] [rag-cli](https://github.com/ItMeDiaTech/rag-cli) — Local RAG using Chroma vector embeddings for Claude Code
- [ ] Direct-code RAG recipe — Skip MCP, use Python + ChromaDB directly (pattern at ~/cc_agents/recipes/chromadb.md)
- [ ] GraphRAG — Microsoft's graph-augmented retrieval. When is it worth the complexity vs plain vector RAG?
- [ ] RAG evaluation frameworks — RAGAS and alternatives for measuring retrieval quality
- [ ] Hybrid search patterns — BM25 + vector search combination, fusion strategies
- [ ] Embedding model comparison 2026 — Nomic, Jina, BGE vs all-MiniLM-L6-v2. What's current best for code+docs?
