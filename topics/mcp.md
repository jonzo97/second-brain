## To Configure

- [ ] **NotebookLM MCP** - Set up and connect the NotebookLM MCP server to Claude Code. Would enable querying NotebookLM sources/notebooks directly from the CLI.
- [ ] **[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)** - Research whether Obsidian is the right tool for organizing this "second brain." Markdown-based, local-first, plugin ecosystem, graph view for connections. Potential future integration with OpenClaw. Needs a research deep-dive to evaluate fit.
